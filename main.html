	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>Time complexity explains how an algorithm's running time grows with input size. An efficient solution reduces time complexity while staying corect.</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> describes the extra memory an algorithm needs relative to input size. It is often expressed using Big O such as O(n).</p>
